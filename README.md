Snake Game
    This is a classic Snake Game implemented using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple yet addictive game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself and the boundaries of the game board.
Gameplay
    Objective: Guide the snake to eat food and grow longer without colliding with itself or the walls.
    Controls: Use arrow keys to change the direction of the snake's movement.
    Scoring: Each time the snake eats food, the score increases by one.
    Game Over: The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the walls. The highest score achieved is displayed.

Features
    Responsive Design: The game adapts to different screen sizes for a consistent experience across devices.
    Audio Feedback: Sound effects are provided for eating food, moving the snake, and game over events.
    Touch Support: Swipe gestures are supported for controlling the snake's movement on touch devices.
